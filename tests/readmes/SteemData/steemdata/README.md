## SteemData
The goal of the SteemData project is to make data from the
STEEM blockchain more accessible to developers, researchers and 3rd party services.

This repo contains utilities for parsing STEEM blockchain, retrieving price feeds and some extra helpers.

For the main repo behind SteemData functionality, see [steemdata-mongo](https://github.com/SteemData/steemdata-mongo).
