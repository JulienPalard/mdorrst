PyMamba is a Python library designed to turn the LMDB storage engine into a relatively complete 
Database package for use in Python3 applications. In the spirit of the language title, this 
package is named after the fastest snake on the planet (Black Mamba) as a nod to the speed of 
the LMDB storage engine weâ€™re leaning on.
