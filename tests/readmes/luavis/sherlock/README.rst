    < Ditective who program with Shell script >

Shell script is well known script language which is used in most of unix-like OS. Shell script lanuage garuntee to run in most unix-like OS. So many software developers are using this language when they program install script or configuration script. Because this language is really old, There are several `problems <http://teaching.idallen.com/cst8207/16w/notes/740_script_problems.html>`_. and it is hard to maintain program which is writted by shell script language.

Install
-------

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install sherlock.py

Sherlock.py supports python version over 2.6 or 3.3. and support linux and macOS. If there is error in install please write issue.

Usage
-----

::

    usage: sherlock [-h] [-o output] [-c] [-v] [--version] [file | command]

    Python to bash trans-compiler.

    positional arguments:
      [file | command]  program read from script file

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      -o output         output file path
      -c, --command     program passed in as string
      -v, --verbose     program run in verbose mode
      --version         show program's version number and exit

Following is basic usage.

.. code:: sh

    $ sherlock target.py

Using this command, target.py file is translated into bash shell sciprt. after, it is automatically run with ``sh``. We can find out bug from the running result.

.. code:: sh

    $ sherlock target.py -o output.sh

Using ``-o`` flag, you can save sherlock result in file. In this case script isn't run automatically.

.. code:: sh

    $ sherlock -c "echo 'Hello World.'"

Using ``-c`` flag, input command is immediately translated to bash shell script language and executed.

If you want to details. Please check `sample codes <https://github.com/Luavis/sherlock.py/tree/master/samples>`__

Library

**sherlock.cmd package**

You can use general shell command importing from sherlock.cmd. When you import package, it check user already installed command and create wrap function which return stdout output.
