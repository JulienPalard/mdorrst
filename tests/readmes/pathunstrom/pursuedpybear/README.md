## A Python Game Engine

Ppb is a project to build a beginner's game engine using the lessons
learned from trying to build small games in python.

## Guiding Principles

* Education Friendly
* Idiomatic Python
* Object Oriented
* Event Driven
* Hardware Library Agnostic

## Try it

_Note: Version 0.2.0 is currently not supported with the examples._

The current example framecount.py uses the terminal as your view. It outputs
and the current runtime to the terminal at a rate of 60 per second.

## Compatibility

PPB uses Python 3, but is currently backwards compatible to Python 2.7. 
Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

The API is not currently fixed. Do not count on the API to remain consistent 
between versions.
