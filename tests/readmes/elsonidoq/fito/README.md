# About
Fito is to Data Science what SQLAlchemy is for data bases.
Fito is the Data Science ORM.

It helps you organize you code and integrate
different technologies while handling a consistent and clear 
object model.

Things like:
 * Mapping between config files and behaviour, 
 * Caching results of execution (in memory, or in any key value store)
 * Or attaching metadata to executions (like metrics, scores, plots, etc)
  
become trivial

# Functionality

Fito is a package that works around four concepts:
First there are `Specs`. A `Spec` specifies an object.
It provides the capability of specifiyng things, like models or data sources.
Also an `Spec` can be combined with another `Spec` which allows them to specify
things like experiments that combine both models and data sources.
Specs are both **json-serializable** and **hasheable**.
  
An `Operation` is an `Spec` that computes something out of it. Can be though
as a [currified function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying#Illustration)

That leads us to the `DataStore`, whose capability is to index an `Spec` (or any subclass, of course).
There are three implementations, one that uses python dictionaries, another uses the file system and 
a third one backed on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

One nice combination of having this abstraction, is that we can do automatic caching.
That can be performed just by linking operations and data stores together 

Besides that, fito provides very helpful decorator, `as_operation` that 
turns any function into a subclass of `Operation`.

# How does it look like?
It looks like this
```
from fito.data_store import DictDataStore
from fito import as_operation

ds = DictDataStore() # Can be any implementation of data store

@as_operation(cache_on=ds)
def f(x, y=1):
    return x + y

f(1).execute() # executed
f(1).execute() # retrieved from cache
```

That code is enough to cache the executions of `f` into memory

You can see more examples here:
* A [simple execution flow](https://github.com/elsonidoq/fito/blob/master/examples/Simple%20Flow.ipynb): 
Shows how operations can be used to express entities linked together by their execution

* The [auto caching decorator](https://github.com/elsonidoq/fito/blob/master/examples/Auto%20Caching.ipynb): 
Shows how operations joint with data stores can be used for automatic function caching

* The [execution FIFO](https://github.com/elsonidoq/fito/blob/master/examples/Expensive%20computations.ipynb): 
Shows how we can leverage on execution cache to avoid recomputing recently executed operations
