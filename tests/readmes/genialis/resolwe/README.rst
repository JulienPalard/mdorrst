Resolwe is an open source dataflow package for `Django framework`_. We envision
Resolwe to follow the `Common Workflow Language`_ specification, but the
current implementation does not yet fully support it. Resolwe offers a complete
RESTful API to connect with external resources. A collection of bioinformatics
pipelines is available in `Resolwe Bioinformatics`_.

Install
=======

Prerequisites
-------------

Make sure you have Python_ (2.7 or 3.4+) installed on your system. If you don't
have it yet, follow `these instructions
<https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html>`__.

Resolwe requires PostgreSQL_ (9.4+). Many Linux distributions already include
the required version of PostgreSQL (e.g. Fedora 22+, Debian 8+, Ubuntu 15.04+)
and you can simply install it via distribution's package manager.
Otherwise, follow `these instructions
<https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides>`__.

Additionally, installing the ``psycopg2`` dependency from PyPI_ will require
having a C compiler (e.g. GCC_) as well as Python and PostgreSQL development
files installed on the system.

Note
^^^^

The preferred way to install the C compiler and Python and PostgreSQL
development files is to use your distribution's packages, if they exist. For
example, on a Fedora/RHEL-based system, that would mean installing ``gcc``,
``python-devel``/``python3-devel`` and ``postgresql-devel`` packages.

.. _PostgreSQL: http://www.postgresql.org/
.. _PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/
.. _GCC: https://gcc.gnu.org/

From PyPI_
----------

.. code::

    pip install --process-dependency-links resolwe

From source
-----------

.. code::

   pip install --process-dependency-links https://github.com/genialis/resolwe/archive/<git-tree-ish>.tar.gz

where ``<git-tree-ish>`` can represent any commit SHA, branch name, tag name,
etc. in `Resolwe's GitHub repository`_. For example, to install the latest
Resolwe from the ``master`` branch, use:

.. code::

   pip install --process-dependency-links https://github.com/genialis/resolwe/archive/master.tar.gz
