Django cradmin
==============
Django custom role based admin UI.

Django cradmin is in BETA. The system is fairly stable, but:

- We do not have getting started guides.
- We should have better tests before release. Some parts have been prototyped
  a lot while we tested out different concepts, and they need a complexity
  review and better tests.
