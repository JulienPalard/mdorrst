**Bitmask** is the client for the services offered by `the LEAP Platform`_. It
contains a command-line interface and a multiplatform desktop client. It can be
also used as a set of libraries to communicate with the different services from
third party applications.

It is written in python using `Twisted`_  and licensed under the `GPL3`_. The
Graphical User Interface is written in html+js and uses `PyQt5`_ for serving
the application.

Package under development!
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is a unified repo that has merged the following packages, previously
isolated, under the leap namespace:

bonafide, mail, keymanager, bitmask.

The previous Qt client has been deprecated (bitmask version 0.9.2, still
available at the http://github.com/leapcode/bitmask_client repo).

Note that this repo still doesn't have support for VPN: its porting will
follow soon.

Read the Docs!
-----------------------------------------------------------

The latest documentation about Bitmask is available at `LEAP`_.

Bugs
===========================================================

Please report any bugs `in our bug tracker`_.

Logs
----

If you want to watch the logs, from the command line::

  bitmaskctl logs watch

The paste command can be handy to do bug reports (needs ``pastebinit`` installed
in the system)::

  bitmaskctl logs send




Development
===========================================================

Running Tests
-----------------------------------------------------------

You need tox to run the tests. If you don't have it in your system yet::

  pip install tox

And then run all the tests::

  tox


Hacking
-----------------------------------------------------------

In order to run bitmask in a development environment, you must activate a
virtualenv and install the various packages using 'pip install -e'. This
installs python packages as links to the source code, so that your code
changes are immediately reflected in the packages installed in the
virtualenv.

The various ``make dev-*`` commands will run the appropriate ``pip install``
commands for you.

Run headless backend in development mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Prerequisites::

  sudo apt install build-essential python-dev python-virtualenv \
                   libsqlcipher-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev

Install and activate a virtualenv::

  cd bitmask-dev
  virtualenv venv
  source venv/bin/activate

All the subsequent commands assume that you have activated the virtualenv.

Install all the python dependencies::

  make dev-backend

Run application::

  bitmaskd

Run user interface frontend
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to run the Bitmask user interface, you additionally need the
following:

Prerequisites::

  sudo apt install python-pyqt5  python-pyqt5.qtwebkit

Install python dependencies::

  make dev-all

Note: even though the UI is in javascript, Qt is used to create a webview
window.

Run user interface::

  bitmask

The command `bitmask` should be in your path if you have activated the virtual
environment.

Install Bitmask user interface in development mode
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The above instructions will install a python package that contains a pre-
bundled version of the javascript UI.

If you want to modify the javascript UI, then you need to be able to update the
javascript bundle whenever a javascript or CSS source file changes. To support
this, we build a python package of the javascript UI and install it in
"development mode" so that changes to the contents of the package are reflected
in bitmaskd immediately.

Prerequisites::

  sudo apt install nodejs npm nodejs-legacy

Next, run ``dev-install``::

  cd ui
  make dev-install

Now you should be able to run the user interface with debugging tools::

  bitmaskd
  cd ui
  npm run ui

This command is the same as running:

  chromium-browser "http://localhost:7070/#$(cat ~/.config/leap/authtoken)"

Firefox does not work as well, because the UI is only tested with webkit-based
browsers.

Chromium is not the most ideal, however, because it uses a newer webkit than is
available in Qt. Instead, try qupzilla::

  sudo apt install qupzilla
  bitmaskd
  qupzilla -ow "http://localhost:7070/#$(cat ~/.config/leap/authtoken)"

If you make a change to any of the CSS or JS source files, you need to rebuild
the javascript bundle. You can do this continually as files change like so::

  cd ui
  node run watch

The new javascript bundle will be used when you refresh the page so long as
``make dev-install`` was previously run.

For more information, see ``ui/README.md``.
