# woff2otf

This is a python module to convert WOFF files to the OTF font format. This library is based on the original [hanikesn/woff2otf](https://github.com/hanikesn/woff2otf) utility. I just ported it as a extensible library to use in a personal project.

Contributions and suggestions could be send to this repo or to the original one.

## Usage
