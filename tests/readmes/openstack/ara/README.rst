ARA: Ansible Run Analysis
=========================
.. image:: doc/source/_static/ara-with-icon.png

ARA is an open source project that was created by Ansible users for Ansible
users.

Its purpose is to provide a way to simply and easily understand what happens
throughout playbook runs at any scale.

ARA records Ansible playbook runs and makes the recorded data available and
intuitive for users and systems.

TL;DR
=====

ARA_ records Ansible_ Playbook runs seamlessly to make them easier to
visualize, understand and troubleshoot. It integrates with Ansible wherever you
run it.

ARA provides four things:

1. An `Ansible callback plugin`_ to record playbook runs into a local or remote database
2. The ara_record_ and ara_read_ pair of Ansible modules to record and read persistent data with ARA
3. A `CLI client`_ to query the database
4. A `dynamic, database-driven web interface`_ that can also be `generated and served from static files`_
