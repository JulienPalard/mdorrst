# PictureFlow

PictureFlow is an image processing library that aims to simplify the way we think about modifying images. It depends on [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) for most image manipulation tasks, altough we have plans to support more backends in the future. We currently only support Python 3.6+, but efforts to make the project compatible with 2.7+ and < 3.6 are very welcome!

### Via `pip`

```shell
$ pip install pictureflow
```



### Manually

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:mentum/pictureflow.git
