The SatPy package is a python library for reading and manipulating
meteorological remote sensing data and writing it to various image and
data file formats. SatPy comes with the ability to make various RGB
composites directly from satellite instrument channel data or higher level
processing output. The
`pyresample <http://pyresample.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package is used
to resample data to different uniform areas or grids.

The documentation is available at
http://satpy.readthedocs.org/.
