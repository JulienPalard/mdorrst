## After install

  Ensure that you have specified the region you want to work on.
  You can do this in one of two ways:
  
    1. You can specify you region in your ~/.aws/config file
      ```
        [default]
        region=us-west-2
      ```
    2. You can use the following environment variable
        ```
        export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
        ```
