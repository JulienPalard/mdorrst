Exchange Web Services client library
====================================
This module provides an well-performing, well-behaving, platform-independent and simple interface for communicating with
a Microsoft Exchange 2007-2016 Server or Office365 using Exchange Web Services (EWS). It currently implements
autodiscover, and functions for searching, creating, updating, deleting, exporting and uploading calendar, mailbox, task
and contact items.

Usage
-----
Here are some examples of how `exchangelib` works:


Setup and connecting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    from exchangelib import DELEGATE, IMPERSONATION, Account, Credentials, ServiceAccount, \
        EWSDateTime, EWSTimeZone, Configuration, NTLM, CalendarItem, Message, \
        Mailbox, Attendee, Q, Calendar, ExtendedProperty, FileAttachment, ItemAttachment, \
        HTMLBody, Build, Version

    # Username in WINDOMAIN\username format. Office365 wants usernames in PrimarySMTPAddress
    # ('myusername@example.com') format. UPN format is also supported.
    credentials = Credentials(username='MYWINDOMAIN\\myusername', password='topsecret')

    # If you're running long-running jobs, you may want to enable fault-tolerance. Fault-tolerance
    # means that requests to the server do an exponential backoff and sleep for up to a certain
    # threshold before giving up, if the server is unavailable or responding with error messages.
    # This prevents automated scripts from overwhelming a failing or overloaded server, and hides
    # intermittent service outages that often happen in large Exchange installations.

    # If you want to enable the fault tolerance, create credentials as a service account instead:
    credentials = ServiceAccount(username='FOO\\bar', password='topsecret')

    # Set up a target account and do an autodiscover lookup to find the target EWS endpoint:
    account = Account(primary_smtp_address='john@example.com', credentials=credentials,
                      autodiscover=True, access_type=DELEGATE)

    # If your credentials have been given impersonation access to the target account, set a
    # different 'access_type':
    account = Account(primary_smtp_address='john@example.com', credentials=credentials,
                      autodiscover=True, access_type=IMPERSONATION)


    # If the server doesn't support autodiscover, use a Configuration object to set the server
    # location:
    config = Configuration(server='mail.example.com', credentials=credentials)
    account = Account(primary_smtp_address='john@example.com', config=config,
                      autodiscover=False, access_type=DELEGATE)

    # 'exchangelib' will attempt to guess the server version and authentication method. If you
    # have a really bizarre or locked-down installation and the guessing fails, or you want to avoid
    # the extra network traffic, you can set the auth method and version explicitly instead:
    version = Version(build=Build(15, 0, 12, 34))
    config = Configuration(server='example.com', credentials=credentials, version=version, auth_type=NTLM)

    # If you're connecting to the same account very often, you can cache the autodiscover result for
    # later so you can skip the autodiscover lookup:
    ews_url = account.protocol.service_endpoint
    ews_auth_type = account.protocol.auth_type
    primary_smtp_address = account.primary_smtp_address

    # 5 minutes later, fetch the cached values and create the account without autodiscovering:
    config = Configuration(service_endpoint=ews_url, credentials=credentials, auth_type=ews_auth_type)
    account = Account(
        primary_smtp_address=primary_smtp_address, config=config, autodiscover=False, access_type=DELEGATE
    )


Folders
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    # The most common folders are available as account.calendar, account.trash, account.drafts, account.inbox,
    # account.outbox, account.sent, account.junk, account.tasks, and account.contacts.
    #
    # If you want to access other folders, you can either traverse the account.folders dictionary, or find
    # the folder by name, starting at a direct or indirect parent of the folder you want to find. To search
    # the full folder hirarchy, start the search from account.root:
    python_dev_mail_folder = account.root.get_folder_by_name('python-dev')
    # If you have multiple folders with the same name in your folder hierarchy, start your search further down
    # the hierarchy:
    foo1_folder = account.inbox.get_folder_by_name('foo')
    foo2_folder = python_dev_mail_folder.get_folder_by_name('foo')
    # For more advanced folder traversing, use some_folder.get_folders()

    # Folders have some useful counters:
    account.inbox.total_count
    account.inbox.child_folder_count
    account.inbox.unread_count
    # Update the counters
    account.inbox.refresh()


Creating and sending
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    # Create the calendar items in the user's standard calendar.  If you want to access a
    # non-standard calendar, choose a different one from account.folders[Calendar]
    #
    # You can create, update and delete single items
    item = CalendarItem(folder=account.calendar, subject='foo')
    item.save()
    item.subject = 'bar'
    item.save()
    item.delete()

    # You can also send emails:

    # If you don't want a local copy
    m = Message(
        account=a,
        subject='Daily motivation',
        body='All bodies are beautiful',
        to_recipients=[Mailbox(email_address='anne@example.com')]
    )
    m.send()

    # Or, if you want a copy in e.g. the 'Sent' folder
    m = Message(
        account=a,
        folder=a.sent,
        subject='Daily motivation',
        body='All bodies are beautiful',
        to_recipients=[Mailbox(email_address='anne@example.com')]
    )
    m.send_and_save()

    # EWS distinquishes between plain text and HTML body contents. If you want to send HTML body content, use
    # the HTMLBody helper. Clients will see this as HTML and display the body correctly:
    item.body = HTMLBody('<html><body>Hello happy <blink>OWA user!</blink></body></html>')
    year, month, day = 2016, 3, 20
    tz = EWSTimeZone.timezone('Europe/Copenhagen')


Bulk operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    # Build a list of calendar items
    calendar_items = []
    for hour in range(7, 17):
        calendar_items.append(CalendarItem(
            start=tz.localize(EWSDateTime(year, month, day, hour, 30)),
            end=tz.localize(EWSDateTime(year, month, day, hour + 1, 15)),
            subject='Test item',
            body='Hello from Python',
            location='devnull',
            categories=['foo', 'bar'],
            required_attendees = [Attendee(
                mailbox=Mailbox(email_address='user1@example.com'),
                response_type='Accept'
            )]
        ))

    # bulk_update() and bulk_delete() methods are also supported.
    res = account.calendar.bulk_create(items=calendar_items)
    print(res)


Searching
^^^^^^^^^

Searching is modeled after the Django QuerySet API, and a large part of the API is supported. Like
in Django, the QuerySet is lazy and doesn't fetch anything before the QuerySet is iterated. QuerySets
support chaining, so you can build the final query in multiple steps, and you can re-use a base
QuerySet for multiple sub-searches. The QuerySet returns an iterator, and results are cached when the
QuerySet is fully iterated the first time.

Here are some examples of using the API:

.. code-block:: python

    # Let's get the calendar items we just created.
    all_items = my_folder.all()  # Get everything
    all_items_without_caching = my_folder.all().iterator()  # Get everything, but don't cache
    filtered_items = my_folder.filter(subject__contains='foo').exclude(categories__icontains='bar')  # Chaining
    status_report = my_folder.all().delete()  # Delete the items returned by the QuerySet
    items_for_2017 = my_calendar.filter(start__range=(
        tz.localize(EWSDateTime(2017, 1, 1)),
        tz.localize(EWSDateTime(2018, 1, 1))
    ))  # Filter by a date range
    # Same as filter() but throws an error if exactly one item isn't returned
    item = my_folder.get(subject='unique_string')

    # You can sort by a single or multiple fields. Prefix a field with '-' to reverse the sorting. Sorting is efficient
    # since it is done server-side.
    ordered_items = my_folder.all().order_by('subject')
    reverse_ordered_items = my_folder.all().order_by('-subject')
    sorted_by_home_street = my_contacts.all().order_by('physical_addresses__Home__street')  # Indexed properties
    dont_do_this = my_huge_folder.all().order_by('subject', 'categories')[:10]  # This is efficient

    # Counting and exists
    n = my_folder.all().count()  # Efficient counting
    folder_is_empty = not my_folder.all().exists()  # Efficient tasting

    # Restricting returned attributes
    sparse_items = my_folder.all().only('subject', 'start')
    # Dig deeper on indexed properties
    sparse_items = my_contacts.all().only('phone_numbers')
    sparse_items = my_contacts.all().only('phone_numbers__CarPhone')
    sparse_items = my_contacts.all().only('physical_addresses__Home__street')

    # Returning values instead of objects
    ids_as_dict = my_folder.all().values('item_id', 'changekey')  # Return values as dicts, not objects
    values_as_list = my_folder.all().values_list('subject', 'body')  # Return values as nested lists
    all_subjects = my_folder.all().values_list('physical_addresses__Home__street', flat=True)  # Return a flat list

    # A QuerySet can be sliced like a normal Python list. Slicing from the start of the QuerySet
    # is efficient (it only fetches the necessary items), but more exotic slicing requires many or all
    # items to be fetched from the server. Slicing from the end is also efficient, but then you might as
    # well just reverse the sorting.
    first_ten_emails = my_folder.all().order_by('-datetime_received')[:10]  # Efficient
    last_ten_emails = my_folder.all().order_by('-datetime_received')[:-10]  # Efficient, but convoluted
    next_ten_emails = my_folder.all().order_by('-datetime_received')[10:20]  # Still quite efficient
    eviction_warning = my_folder.all().order_by('-datetime_received')[34298]  # This is looking for trouble
    some_random_emails = my_folder.all().order_by('-datetime_received')[::3]  # This is just stupid

    # The syntax for filter() is modeled after Django QuerySet filters. The following filter lookup types
    # are supported. Some lookups only work with string attributes, some only with date or numerical
    # attributes, and some attributes are not searchable at all:
    qs = account.calendar.all()
    qs.filter(subject='foo')  # Returns items where subject is exactly 'foo'. Case-sensitive
    qs.filter(start__range=(dt1, dt2))  # Returns items starting within range. Only for date and numerical types
    qs.filter(subject__in=('foo', 'bar'))  # Return items where subject is either 'foo' or 'bar'
    qs.filter(subject__not='foo')  # Returns items where subject is not 'foo'
    qs.filter(start__gt=dt)  # Returns items starting after 'dt'.  Only for date and numerical types
    qs.filter(start__gte=dt)  # Returns items starting on or after 'dt'.  Only for date and numerical types
    qs.filter(start__lt=dt)  # Returns items starting before 'dt'.  Only for date and numerical types
    qs.filter(start__lte=dt)  # Returns items starting on or before 'dt'.  Only for date and numerical types
    qs.filter(subject__exact='foo')  #  Returns items where subject is 'foo'. Same as filter(subject='foo')
    qs.filter(subject__iexact='foo')  #  Returns items where subject is 'foo', 'FOO' or 'Foo'
    qs.filter(subject__contains='foo')  #  Returns items where subject contains 'foo'
    qs.filter(subject__icontains='foo')  # Returns items where subject contains 'foo', 'FOO' or 'Foo'
    qs.filter(subject__startswith='foo')  # Returns items where subject starts with 'foo'
    qs.filter(subject__istartswith='foo')  # Returns items where subject starts with 'foo', 'FOO' or 'Foo'
    # Returns items that have at least one category set, i.e. the field exists on the item on the server
    qs.filter(categories__exists=True)
    # Returns items that have no categories set, i.e. the field does not exist on the item on the server
    qs.filter(categories__exists=False)

    # filter() also supports EWS QueryStrings. Just pass the string to filter(). QueryStrings cannot be combined with
    # other filters. We make no attempt at validating the syntax of the QueryString - we just pass the string verbatim
    # to EWS.
    #
    # Read more about the QueryString syntax here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee693615.aspx
    items = my_folder.filter('subject:XXX')

    # filter() also supports Q objects that are modeled after Django Q objects, for building complex
    # boolean logic search expressions.
    q = (Q(subject__iexact='foo') | Q(subject__contains='bar')) & ~Q(subject__startswith='baz')
    items = my_folder.filter(q)

    # In this example, we filter by categories so we only get the items created by us.
    items = account.calendar.filter(
        start__lt=tz.localize(EWSDateTime(year, month, day + 1)),
        end__gt=tz.localize(EWSDateTime(year, month, day)),
        categories__contains=['foo', 'bar'],
    )
    for item in items:
        print(item.start, item.end, item.subject, item.body, item.location)

    # By default, EWS returns only the master recurring item. If you want recurring calendar
    # items to be expanded, use calendar.view(start=..., end=...) instead.
    items = account.calendar.view(
        start=tz.localize(EWSDateTime(year, month, day + 1)),
        end=tz.localize(EWSDateTime(year, month, day)),
    )
    for item in items:
        print(item.start, item.end, item.subject, item.body, item.location)


Deleting
^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    # Delete the calendar items we found, when 'items' is a queryset
    res = items.delete()
    print(res)


Extended properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    # If folder items have extended properties, you need to register them before you can access them. Create
    # a subclass of ExtendedProperty and set your custom property_id:
    class LunchMenu(ExtendedProperty):
        property_set_id = '12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456781234'
        property_name = 'Catering from the cafeteria'
        property_type = 'String'

    # Register the property on the item type of your choice
    CalendarItem.register('lunch_menu', LunchMenu)
    # Now your property is available as the attribute 'lunch_menu', just like any other attribute
    item = CalendarItem(..., lunch_menu='Foie gras et consommé de légumes')
    item.save()
    for i in account.calendar.all():
        print(i.lunch_menu)
    # If you change your mind, jsut remove the property again
    CalendarItem.deregister('lunch_menu')


Attachments
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    # It's possible to create, delete and get attachments connected to any item type:
    # Process attachments on existing items. FileAttachments have a 'content' attribute
    # containing the binary content of the file, and ItemAttachments have an 'item' attribute
    # containing the item. The item can be a Message, CalendarItem, Task etc.
    for item in my_folder.all():
        for attachment in item.attachments:
            if isinstance(attachment, FileAttachment):
                local_path = os.path.join('/tmp', attachment.name)
                with open(local_path, 'wb') as f:
                    f.write(attachment.content)
                print('Saved attachment to', local_path)
            elif isinstance(attachment, ItemAttachment):
                if isinstance(attachment.item, Message):
                    print(attachment.item.subject, attachment.item.body)

    # Create a new item with an attachment
    item = Message(...)
    binary_file_content = 'Hello from unicode æøå'.encode('utf-8')  # Or read from file, BytesIO etc.
    my_file = FileAttachment(name='my_file.txt', content=binary_file_content)
    item.attach(my_file)
    my_calendar_item = CalendarItem(...)
    my_appointment = ItemAttachment(name='my_appointment', item=my_calendar_item)
    item.attach(my_appointment)
    item.save()

    # Add an attachment on an existing item
    my_other_file = FileAttachment(name='my_other_file.txt', content=binary_file_content)
    item.attach(my_other_file)

    # Remove the attachment again
    item.detach(my_file)

    # Be aware that adding and deleting attachments from items that are already created in Exchange
    # (items that have an item_id) will update the changekey of the item.


Notes
^^^^^

Most, but not all, item attributes are supported. Addeing more attributes is usually uncomplicated. Feel
free to open a PR or an issue.

Item export and upload is supported, for efficient backup, restore and migration.
