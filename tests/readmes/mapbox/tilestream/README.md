TileStream
----------
TileStream is a high-performance map tile server powered by [MBTiles][1].

It's like TileCache, TileStache, and other map servers in that it serves normal
image files that can be used in OpenLayers, Google Maps, Modest Maps, and other
Javascript APIs without much trouble - and with lots of enhancements when you
use [Mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js).

It's not like those tile servers in that it doesn't yet generate maps, it only
serves maps that are generated with [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill).
This means that it's reliably fast but not designed to serve live data.

[MapBox Hosting](http://mapbox.com/hosting/) uses the same internals as
TileStream but adds many features and is a hosted service rather than an
installable application.


Features
--------
- MBTiles-based tile server
- Minimal gallery view and map viewer for tiles
- Support for MBTiles interaction using [Mapbox.js][2]


Requirements
------------
- Node.js v0.10.x or v0.8.x

After installing Node.js you can should have the `npm` command.


Installation
------------

You can use `npm` to install TileStream:

    git clone https://github.com/mapbox/tilestream.git
    cd tilestream
    npm install

Start TileStream:

    ./index.js

Get options:

    ./index.js start --help

TileStream should now be accessible from a browser at `http://localhost:8888`.

#### Installation note: OS X

Installing Node.js via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (`brew install node`), the [PKG installer](http://nodejs.org/download/), or [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) are all good ways to install Node.js.

#### Installation note: Ubuntu

If installing on ubuntu we recommend installing Node.js via the `chris-lea` PPA:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs-dev npm

Usage
-----

Start TileStream:

    ./index.js start

Get options:

    ./index.js start --help
    
If something goes wrong during the install you can do a complete install by doing

    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install

Some handy options::
    
    ./index.js start --uiPort=[80] --tilePort=[80] --tiles=/usr/share/tilestream

The above example specifies custom ports for the user interface and the tile store, and
also demonstrates how to specify a directory other than `~/Documents/MapBox/tiles`
for the mbtiles directory.


Custom configuration
--------------------

If you intend to run TileStream as a server on a hostname or an IP rather than
as localhost, specify that hostname when you run TileStream:

    tilestream --host 127.0.0.1
    tilestream --host yourhost.com

In these examples, you would only be able to access tilestream from `127.0.0.1`
or `yourhost.com`, respectively, due to security restrictions.

You can also specify the hostname TileStream should use for URLs in its
responses by setting a custom `tileHost` value:

    tilestream --tileHost yourhost.com
    ./index.js start --tileHost="yourhost.com"

This is useful if you want to sit your TileStream server behind a proxy (such as
nginx) and restrict direct access to TileStream:

    tilestream --tileHost yourhost.com --host 127.0.0.1
    ./index.js start --tileHost="yourhost.com" --host="127.0.0.1"

These configuration flags can also be set using a JSON file:

    ./index.js start --config config.json

Where `config.json` is something like:

    {
      "host": ["127.0.0.1"],
      "tileHost": "yourhost.com",
      "tilePort": 8888,
      "uiPort": 8888
    }


Configuration
-------------

MBTiles files should be placed in the `~/Documents/MapBox/tiles` directory,
which is created at first run. Each tileset can be previewed at
`http://localhost:8888/map/[filename]` where `[filename]` is the name of the
tileset file without the `.mbtiles` extension.

Tileset filenames:

- May contain letters (lower or upper case), numbers, underscores or dashes.

        world-light.mbtiles
        control_room.mbtiles
        PartyLikeIts1999.mbtiles

- May not contain periods, spaces, non ASCII characters or other punctuation.

        World Light.mbtiles
        BlueWorld-1.0.mbtiles

To see the options available for use with TileStream, run

    ./index.js start --help


Tests
-----
TileStream tests use [Expresso][6].

    cd tilestream
    npm install expresso
    npm test


### Deployment

See the `configuration_examples` directory for configuration examples with
[nginx](http://nginx.net) and upstart.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you run into problems during install, such as unfound dependent versions, first try deleting the node_modules/ folder and re-run `node install`. It seems that some errors leave the installation in an unclean state (for example if you accidentally switched node versions during the install in the hopes of making things work!).

### Build Failures

`npm install` may cause:

    Waf: Leaving directory '/Users/sundar/Projects/tilestream/node_modules/sqlite3/build'
    Build failed:
    -> task failed (err #1):
    {task: cxx statement.cc -> statement_1.o}
    -> task failed (err #1):
    {task: cxx database.cc -> database_1.o}
    -> task failed (err #1):
    {task: cxx sqlite3.cc -> sqlite3_1.o}
    npm ERR! sqlite3@2.1.1 preinstall: `node-waf clean || (exit 0); node-waf configure build`
    npm ERR! `sh "-c" "node-waf clean || (exit 0); node-waf configure build"` failed with 1
    npm ERR!
    npm ERR! Failed at the sqlite3@2.1.1 preinstall script.

Manually installing sqlite3 via npm install sqlite3 resolved this issue. Then re-run npm install in the tilestream folder:

    npm install sqlite3
    npm install

If you STILL get errors when launching index.js, there may be more modules to install manually. This is the list that worked for me:

    npm install sqlite3
    npm install mbtiles
    npm install jsdom
    npm install uglify-js
    npm install connect
    npm install qs
    npm install mime

But again, all this headache may be solved by just deleting your node_modules/ folder and re-running `npm install`.
