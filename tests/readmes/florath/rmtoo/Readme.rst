Introduction
============

This Readme gives a short overview over the available online
documentation for rmtoo.

Content
=======

This file contains the following chapters:

.. contents:: Table of Contents


Conventions
===========

``YY``
  names the version of rmtoo.  You have to replace this with the real
  version number.

``$ cmd``
  This is a command you have to type in.  The ``$`` is a replacement for
  the shell prompt - do not enter it as a part of the command.


Operating System Support
========================

rmtoo is fully supported under Linux.  Nevertheless, because it is
written in computer independent programming languages (such as
python), is also works on other operating systems.

Mac OS X users might want to read ``Readme-OS-X.txt``.

Windows users might want to read the ``Readme-Windows.txt``.


Installation
============

The following sections assume, that you are using Linux.  Please
refer to the appropriate Readme file for your operating system for
more information if you do not use Linux.

Dependencies
------------

To use rmtoo, other software packages must be installed.

rmtoo is written in python.  At least version 2.7 of python is needed.
Starting with version 24 python >3.4 is also supported.

When you want to create LaTeX or PDF documentation, LaTeX is needed.

For the requirements dependency graph, graphviz is used.

For statistics plot gnuplot is used.  For the estimation module the
python-scipy package is needed.

Typically the packages from your distribution will work.

First Project
-------------

The recommended way of starting is to copy the provided template
project.

The basic steps are:

1) Copy over the template project to some other directory.
2) Set up the environment
3) Run ``make``
4) Check, if everything worked
5) Start changing / adapting things to your needs

Note that during this document the project will be called
'MyNewProject'.  Please adapt the name for your needs.


Installation using virtualenv / pip
===================================

This is the preferred installation method - it takes care that
at least the python dependencies are correctly installed.

Installation
------------

To install ``rmtoo`` in a virtualenv, execute the following steps:

.. code:: bash

   $ mkdir RMTOO
   $ cd RMTOO
   $ virtualenv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   $ pip install --only-binary=numpy,scipy numpy scipy
   $ pip install rmtoo

This has only to be done once.

First Project
=============

Installation
------------

Change to a directory where you want to create the new project. This
is needed only once.

.. code:: bash

   # cd to virtualenv directory - if not already there
   $ cd RMTOO
   $ cp -r venv/rmtoo/contrib/template_project MyNewProject

Usage
-----

To create all the artifacts for the template project, execute

.. code:: bash

   $ cd MyNewProject
   $ source ./setenv.sh VENV
   $ make
   $ ls artifacts

In the artifacts directory there are all the generated files.
A typical workflow is, to change or add requirements, topics or the
configuration in the ``MyNewProject`` directory, run ``make`` again
and check the artifacts.

Man Pages
=========

When using the virtualenv, use

.. code:: bash

   $ man -l venv/rmtoo/doc/man/rmtoo.7

to get an overview over all available man pages.
Those other man pages you can read also with man. Replace the
file name with the appropriate manual page, like:

.. code:: bash

   $ man -l venv/rmtoo/doc/man/rmtoo-analytics.7

the sourceforge project page.  Please visit the projects home page
http://rmtoo.florath.net

Readme-Overview.txt
-------------------
Description of the features of rmtoo.

Readme-Hacking.txt
------------------
Small (and yet unfinished) document how to develop functionality
and modules for rmtoo.

Readme-OS-X.txt
---------------
Hints for Mac Users.

Readme-Windows.txt
------------------
Hints for Windows users.

Readme-RmtooOnRmtoo.txt

Some note about the (internal) use of GitPython.

Emacs Mode for Editing Requirements
===================================

When using the tar package, emacs mode can be loaded in emacs by:
``M-x load-file``
point to ``RMTOO/venv/rmtoo/contrib/req-mode.el``
All files with suffix ``.req`` will now use the requirements editing
mode.
