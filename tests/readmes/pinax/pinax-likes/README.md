## Pinax

[Pinax](http://pinaxproject.com/pinax/) is an open-source platform built on the
Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and
starter project templates.

This app is part of the Pinax ecosystem and is designed for use both with and
independently of other Pinax apps.

## pinax-likes

``pinax-likes`` is a liking app for Django, allowing users to "like" and "unlike"
any model instance in your project. Template tags provide the ability to see who
liked an object, what objects a user liked, and more.

In case of any questions we recommend you [join our Pinax Slack team](http://slack.pinaxproject.com) and ping us there instead of creating an issue on GitHub. Creating issues on GitHub is of course also valid but we are usually able to help you faster if you ping us in Slack.

We also highly recommend reading our [Open Source and Self-Care blog post](http://blog.pinaxproject.com/2016/01/19/open-source-and-self-care/).
