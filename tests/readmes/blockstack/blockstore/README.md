Blockstack is a new decentralized internet where you own your data and your apps run locally without remote servers. 

Blockstack provides decentralized services for naming/DNS, identity, authentication and storage. Developers can use JavaScript libraries to build serverless apps and they don't need to worry about managing infrastructure.

For more info on Blockstack see: http://github.com/blockstack/blockstack

**Blockstack Core is the reference implementation of Blockstack.** It is responsible for processing blockchain transactions, creating virtualchain state, and building the peer network amongst other things. Blockstack Core provides a RESTful interface for clients and also comes with a command-line-interface (CLI).

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started with Blockstack is with pip.

For Debian & Ubuntu:
```
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python-pip python-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev rng-tools libgmp3-dev
$ sudo pip install blockstack --upgrade
```
For macOS: 
```
$ brew install gmp libffi openssl
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
$ sudo pip install blockstack --upgrade
```

You can test your installation by trying:
```
$ blockstack info 
```
which should display the last block processed and the latest consensus hash.

After installation, you can start Blockstack Core and index the blockchain:
```bash
$ blockstack-core --debug start
$ tail -f ~/.blockstack-server/blockstack-server.log
```

Next, visit the [basic usage docs](https://blockstack.org/docs/basic-usage) and [extended usage docs](https://blockstack.org/docs/basic-usage) to learn how to register names of your own, as well as transfer them and associate data with them.
