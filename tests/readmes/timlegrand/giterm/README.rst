Features
========

Giterm is a ncurses-based terminal GUI for Git. It brings information about the current status of your Git working copy right in your terminal, *real-time*.

It exposes in a single view:

- local branches, and which branch you’re currently on
- remote branches, and which branch the current local branch is
  tracking
- commit history, and which commit you are currently working from
- current changes
- a *diff* view of the selected file in the *changes* list


Real-time!
----------

Every change to the working copy (file edition/move or any Git command)
updates the GUI instantly. You can work as usual, and keep a terminal
open with giterm to get instant feedback on your actions.

.. note:: Giterm essentially *shows* Git information. It does not support git actions like commit, checkout, branch switching, committing. Only staging/unstaging is supported at this time.


Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install giterm

If you don’t have ``pip`` installed yet:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -s https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python
    pip install giterm

.. note:: Windows users beware, Python for Windows doesn't come with curses. You need to visit `curses repository <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses>`_, download the version of curses that corresponds to your Windows and version of Python, and then pip install the whl file with the python you plan on using.


Usage
=====

.. code-block:: bash

    cd path/to/git/working/copy
    giterm


Keymap

- [tab]: Toggle panel
- [shift + tab]: Reverse Toggle
- [up]/[down]: Scroll line by line
- [page up]/[page down]: Scroll screen by screen
- [h]: Log history
- [c]: Changes view
- [s]: Staging area
- [d]: Diff view

Requirements
============

Giterm needs the ``git`` executable to be installed and available in the
PATH of your system. Others dependencies should be automatically handled
by ``pip``.


Technical background
====================

Giterm uses subprocesses to call Git shell-based commands, and parses
their outputs to bring the relevant information to the user interface.

It also uses a watchdog to listen file changes in the current working
directory.
