Google API Artifact Manager
===========================

Google API Artifact manager (artman) is a set of modules used to automate the
creation of software artifacts related to APIS defined using `protobuf`_ IDL.

artman is an extensible framework that is responsible for creating all artifacts
related to an API including

- distribution packages in all supported programming languages
- generic documentation websites
- language-specific documentation websites (javadoc, readthedocs, etc)

from the protobuf source IDL and additional configuration in YAML files.

Installation
------------
1. Optional: set up a virtualenv for your Python work. Choose one of
   the following:

   1. (recommended) `virtualenvwrapper`_ so you don't have to keep
      track of where your virtualenv is on the filesystem:
      
      .. code::
         
         sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
         mkvirtualenv --python=`which python3` artman

      To use this virtual environment later:
      
      .. code ::
      
         workon artman

   2. `virtualenv`_ in your current directory:
      
      .. code::
         
         sudo pip install virtualenv
         virtualenv env
         source env/bin/activate

2. Install artman directly from pip:

   .. code::

      pip install googleapis-artman

You may need root privileges if you are not installing inside of a virtualenv.
This will make the ``artman`` command available on your system.

Prerequisites
-------------
1. Install `googleapis`_
2. Install `toolkit`_
3. Install Java
4. Some languages may have additional dependencies; refer to the ``Dockerfile``
   in this repository for canonical installation requirements.

.. _`googleapis`: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis
.. _`toolkit`: https://github.com/googleapis/toolkit


Usage
-----

Before you can use artman, you will need a configuration file. You can run
``configure-artman`` to create a simple configuration file.

For building a GAPIC (the most common task), the usage looks like:

.. code::

    artman --api pubsub --language python

Artman also takes a ``--publish`` argument to decide where to stage the
code. Using ``--publish github`` will create a pull request on GitHub
automatically.


Python Versions
---------------

artman is currently tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.
