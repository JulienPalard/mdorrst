# Sorting Algorithms #
## Description ##
This project includes a various number or sorting algorithms
written in Python.
It was tested with Python 3.4, but should also work with
other Python versions.

The repository, where all the commits will be pushed, is on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Train132/sortingalgorithms).
On [GitHub](https://github.com/DahlitzFlorian/SortingAlgorithms)
appear only the already tested releases. So if you want to
keep up-to-date you should have a look at 
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Train132/sortingalgorithms)
once in a while. If you just want to see the tested releases
available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org) you have to
have a look at [GitHub](https://github.com/DahlitzFlorian/SortingAlgorithms).
