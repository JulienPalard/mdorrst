# Incubator
Where all ideas and discussions happen to lead to new repositories

We will try to keep a repository or file per topic (depending on usage), and we will incorporate regularly propositions from everyone into an "Agreement" file which could be used as a reference.

**If you want to comment a topic** and propose alternative options, embellish propositions, or even simply agree with previous propositions (which would also be very helpful to make choices for the "Agreement"), please add your comments to the corresponding discussion in the "Issues" section.

**If you want to bring up a new topic for discussion**, please create a new file with:
  - a short and descriptive name
  
and a short description containing: 
  - a quick presentation of the topic and its relevance in microRNA research
  - a summary of what is lacking or imperfect 
  - what would be for you the optimal situation 
  - and how would that solve the problems mentioned
