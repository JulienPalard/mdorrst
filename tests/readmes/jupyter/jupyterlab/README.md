An extensible computational environment for Jupyter.

**JupyterLab is a very early developer preview, and is not suitable for
general usage yet. Features and implementation are subject to change. **

With JupyterLab, you can create a computational environment for Jupyter that
meets your workflow needs. Here's a quick preview of JupyterLab (link to 
YouTube):

[![JupyterLab Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/sf8PuLcijuA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf8PuLcijuA)

We have a [roadmap](https://github.com/jupyter/roadmap/blob/master/jupyterlab.md) of planned development.

----

## Prerequisites

Jupyter notebook version 4.2 or later. To check the notebook version:

```bash
jupyter notebook --version
```

### Supported Runtimes

The runtime versions which are currently *known to work*:

- Firefox 49+
- Chrome 39+
- Safari 10+

Earlier browser versions may also work, but come with no guarantees.

JupyterLab uses CSS Variables for styling, which is one reason for the
minimum versions listed above.  IE 11+ or Edge 14 do not support
CSS Variables, and are not directly supported at this time.
A tool like [postcss](http://postcss.org/) can be used to convert the CSS files in the
`jupyterlab/build` directory manually if desired.

----

## Installation

If you use ``conda``, you can install as:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

If you use ``pip``, you can install it as:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab --sys-prefix
```

Start up JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

JupyterLab will open automatically in your browser. You may also access
JupyterLab by entering the notebook server's URL (`http://localhost:8888`) in
the browser.

Instructions on how to install the project from the git sources are available in our [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).
