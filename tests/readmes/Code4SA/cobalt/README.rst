Cobalt is a lightweight Python library for working with `Akoma Ntoso <http://www.akomantoso.org/>`_ Act documents.
It makes it easy to work with Akoma Ntoso metadata, FRBR URIs and generate Tables of Contents for a document.

It is lightweight because most operations are done on the XML document directly without intermediate
objects. You still need to understand how Akoma Ntoso works.

Quickstart
----------

Install using::

    $ pip install cobalt

    >>> from cobalt import Act
    >>> act = Act()
    >>> act.title = "Act 10 of 1980"
    >>> act.frbr_uri = "/za/act/1980/10"
    >>> act.year
    '1980'
    >>> act.number
    '10'
    >>> print act.to_xml()
    [ lots of xml ]
