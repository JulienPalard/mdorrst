## Documentation

You can find this project's documentation on ReadTheDocs:
http://flask-stormpath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/


## Sample Application

If you'd like to hop directly into some code, we've built a sample application,
which demonstrates how Flask-Stormpath can be used to build a very simple
user-facing website with user registration, login, dashboard, etc.

You can find the project on GitHub here:
https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-flask-sample

This application provides a simple local web server that allows you to create
users, log them in, log them out, etc.

You can use this as a reference for implementing `Flask-Stormpath` into your
Flask projects.


## Backend

This library is largely based on the excellent
[Flask-Login](http://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) library.  Most
functionality is piggybacked off this library, including secure user sessions /
etc.

Right now we're rapidly developing this library to make it easy for Flask
developers to add user authentication to their projects without the complication
that comes along with it.
