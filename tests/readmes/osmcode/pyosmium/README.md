# pyosmium

Provides Python bindings for the [Libosmium](https://github.com/osmcode/libosmium) C++
library, a library for working with OpenStreetMap data in a fast and flexible
manner.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/osmcode/pyosmium.png)](http://travis-ci.org/osmcode/pyosmium)


## Dependencies

Python >= 2.7 is supported but a version >= 3.3 is strongly recommended.

You'll need Python setuptools. On Debian/Ubuntu install `python-setuptools`.

pyosmium uses [Boost.Python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/libs/python/doc/index.html)
to create the bindings. On Debian/Ubuntu install `libboost-python-dev`. OS X run
`brew install boost-python` or `brew install boost-python --with-python3`
depending on which python version you want to use. You can also (re)install
both.

Other dependencies are expat, libz, libbz2 and Boost iterator.
See [Libosmium dependencies](http://osmcode.org/libosmium/manual.html#dependencies)
for required packages for various distributions.

You have to compile with the same compiler version python is compiled with on
your system, otherwise it might not work.

## Installation

To compile the bindings, run

    python setup.py build

To compile and install the bindings, run

    python setup.py install --user

to install only for your user, or

    python setup.py install

to install globally.

The setup script uses per default either a globally installed libosmium or
looks for the source in `../libosmium`. You can set a custom location with
`LIBOSMIUM_PREFIX`.

To use a custom boost installation, set `BOOST_PREFIX`.

## Examples

The `example` directory contains small examples on how to use the library.
They are mostly ports of the examples in Libosmium and osmium-contrib.


## Testing

There is a small test suite in the test directory. This provides regression
test for the python bindings, it is not meant to be a test suite for Libosmium.

You'll need the Python `nose` module. On Debian/Ubuntu install the package
`python-nose`.

The suite can be run with:

    cd test
    python run_tests.py


## Documentation

To build the documentation you need [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/)
and the [autoprogram extension](https://pythonhosted.org/sphinxcontrib-autoprogram/)
On Debian/Ubuntu install `python-sphinx sphinxcontrib-autoprogram`
or `python3-sphinx python3-sphinxcontrib.autoprogram`.

First compile the bindings as described above and then run:

    cd doc
    make html

For building the man pages for the tools run:

    cd doc
    make man
