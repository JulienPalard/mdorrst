This is still a work in progress and **only** supports XL-320 and **only**
version 2.0 of their protocol. The library is divided up as follows:

 - pyxl320
 	- **ServoSerial** - half duplex hardware serial interface
	- **Packet** - creates packets to talk to the servo
	- **utils** - misc
	- **xl320** - register/command/error definitions for Dynamixel's XL-320 servo

**New:** pyXL320 now supports python2 and python3.

Setup
--------

Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The suggested way to install this is via the ``pip`` command as follows::

	pip install pyxl320

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To submit git pulls, clone the repository and set it up as follows::

	git clone https://github.com/walchko/pyxl320
	cd pyxl320
	pip install -e .

Usage
--------

The ``\bin`` directory has a number of useful programs to set servo position or ID number. Just
run the command with the ``--help`` flag to see how to use it.

==================== ==============================================================
Command              Description
==================== ==============================================================
``servo_ping.py``    pings one or all of the servos
``servo_reboot.py``  reboots one or all servos
``servo_reset.py``   resets one or all servos to a specified level
``set_angle.py``     sets the angle of a given servo
``set_baud_rate.py`` change the baud rate of the servos
``set_id.py``        changes the ID number for a given servo

`Documentation <https://github.com/walchko/pyxl320/tree/master/docs/Markdown>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The documents are stored in markdown files in the repo `here <https://github.com/walchko/pyxl320/tree/master/docs/Markdown>`_
and cover hardware interface and software development. However, a simple example to turn the servo
and turn the LED to green using a USB serial converter:

.. code-block:: python

	from pyxl320 import xl320
	from pyxl320 import ServoSerial, Packet, utils

	serial = ServoSerial('/dev/tty.usbserial')  # tell it what port you want to use
	# serial = ServoSerial('/dev/tty.usbserial', fake=True)  # use a dummy serial interface for testing
	serial.open()

	pkt = Packet.makeServoPacket(1, 158.6)  # move servo 1 to 158.6 degrees
	ret = serial.sendPkt(pkt)  # send packet, I don't do anything with the returned status packet

	pkt = packet.makeLEDPacket(1, pyxl320.XL320_LED_GREEN)
	ret = serial.sendPkt(pkt)
	print('Status packet:', ret)  # here I print out the status packet returned

Although I have made some packet creators (like LED and Servo), you can make
your own using the basic ``makeWritePacket`` and ``makeReadPacket``.

.. code-block:: python

	from pyxl320 import Packet, xl320
	from pyxl320.Packet import le  # creates little endian numbers

	# let's make our own servo packet that sends servo 3 to 220.1 degrees
	ID = 3
	reg = xl320.XL320_GOAL_POSITION
	params = le(int(220.1/300*1023))  # convert 220.1 degrees to an int between 0-1023
	pkt = Packet.makeWritePacket(ID, reg, params)
