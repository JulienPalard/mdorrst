Berry is the partner component for `mint`_. Berry is a tiny agent, that
constantly updates the local credentials file, so that applications can read their most recent passwords easily.

Installation
============

Python 2.7+ is required.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip3 install --upgrade stups-berry

Usage
=====

See the help for configuration options:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ berry --help

In addition, berry takes all the `standard AWS SDK inputs`_
(local credentials file, environment variables and instance profiles).
