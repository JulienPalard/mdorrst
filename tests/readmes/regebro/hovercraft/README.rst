Hovercraft!
===========

*The merge of convenience and cool!*

Hovercraft! is a tool to make impress.js_ presentations from
reStructuredText. For a quick explanation, see the demo_.

Features
--------

* Write your presentations in a text markup language. No slow, limiting GUI, no annoying HTML!

* Pan, rotate and zoom in 3D, with automatic repositioning of slides!

* A presenter console with notes and slide previews!

* The slide show generated is in HTML, so you only need a web browser to show it.

* Easy sharing, as it can be put up on a website for anyone to see!

Full documentation is available at readthedocs.org_, and also in the
documentation subdirectory.

Installation
------------

Hovercraft requires Python 3.2 or later, and can be installed like any Python package.
The easiest way is to install pip_, and then run::

    $ pip3 install hovercraft

Hovercraft is untested on Windows, but there is no reason it shouldn't work, at least in theory.
