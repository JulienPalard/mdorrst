# Roboticia-first
A very simple and low cost robot with 3 degrees of freedom.  It can be easily 3D printed and laser cutted. It works with Dynamixel XL-320 motors, and a Raspberry Pi for control.

The Roboticia-first is ideal to start manipulating robots and learn robotic without difficulties.

It is particularly well suited for educational purposes (cheap, simple to assemble, and easily controllable) or can be a very nice desk decoration for geeks and makers...
