### Requirements
`callisto-core` supports Django 1.8, 1.9, and 1.10, running on Python 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5. Python 2.7 is provisionally supported, pending [further testing](https://github.com/SexualHealthInnovations/callisto-core/issues/19).

`callisto-core` is built on top of [`django-wizard-builder`](https://github.com/SexualHealthInnovations/django-wizard-builder), another open source Django package maintained by Sexual Health Innovations. If you're interested in contributing to Callisto, please check out that repo as well.
