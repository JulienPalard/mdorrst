Defcon
======

Defcon is a set of UFO based objects optimized for use in font editing
applications. The objects are built to be lightweight, fast and
flexible. The objects are very bare-bones and they are not meant to be
end-all, be-all objects. Rather, they are meant to provide base
functionality so that you can focus on your applicationâ€™s behavior, not
object observing or maintaining cached data. Defcon implements UFO3 as
described by the `UFO font format <http://unifiedfontobject.org>`_. If
needed, the
`ufo2-deprecated <https://github.com/typesupply/defcon/tree/ufo2-deprecated>`_
branch has the older, UFO2, version of Defcon.
